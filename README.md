# LLM-Powered Application Development

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates building **applications powered by large language models (LLMs)**. The focus is on integrating LLMs into backend systems and controlling their behavior to create intelligent, AI-driven applications.  

The project highlights how LLMs can be used to handle dynamic inputs, generate meaningful responses, and support practical use cases in real-world application development. It serves as a foundation for building operational ecosystems around LLMs, enabling developers to harness the power of AI in their apps.

## Key Highlights
- Integrated LLMs into backend applications using **Python and Node.js**.  
- Controlled model responses and application logic for predictable, reliable outputs.  
- Demonstrated practical LLM use cases, including text generation and automated workflows.  

## Outcome
The project provides a clear example of how to build **LLM-driven applications** that are intelligent, responsive, and capable of supporting real-world scenarios.
